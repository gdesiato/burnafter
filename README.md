## BurnAfter 
is a zero-knowledge, self-destructing paste service where secrets are encrypted client-side and never exposed to the server.
It features read-once endpoints hardened against enumeration, timing analysis, and other side-channel attacks through uniform responses, randomized delays, and payload padding.
